# Flutter Diagram Web Integration Progress Report

## Completed Steps

### 1. Flutter Web Build Setup
- Created web-optimized version of the engineering coordinates diagram
- Updated the Flutter app initialization to work with web
- Successfully built the web version using `flutter build web --web-renderer canvaskit --release`

### 2. Core Files Created/Modified
- **web_build/lib/main.dart**
  - Initialized Flutter app with web-optimized diagram
  - Set up JavaScript API bridge
  - Removed unnecessary UI elements for web embedding

- **web_build/lib/web_engineering_coords.dart**
  - Created web-optimized version of EngineeringCoords
  - Implemented JavaScript API functions for external control
  - Added position and color update capabilities

- **web_build/lib/utils/diagram_test_base.dart**
  - Updated to use IDiagramLayer interface
  - Fixed CoordinateSystem parameters
  - Implemented proper initialization

### 3. Web Integration
- Set up HTML container and controls
- Implemented JavaScript controls (sliders and color picker)
- Created proper file structure for web deployment

### 4. Bug Fixes
- Fixed DiagramLayer type issues by using IDiagramLayer interface
- Corrected CoordinateSystem parameter structure
- Added proper asset paths and Flutter initialization in HTML

### 5. Asset Management
- Copied built files to integration test directory
- Set up proper asset structure including FontManifest.json
- Configured correct paths for Flutter web assets

## Remaining Tasks

### 1. Debug Diagram Display
- Investigate why diagram is not visible (only grey container showing)
- Add debug logging to Flutter initialization
- Verify JavaScript bridge is working correctly

### 2. Integration Testing
- Test position updates via sliders
- Test color updates via color picker
- Verify bounds checking is working

### 3. Documentation Updates
- Update integration_guide.md with new findings
- Document common issues and solutions
- Add section about asset management

### 4. Optimization
- Verify CanvasKit renderer performance
- Check asset loading efficiency
- Consider adding loading indicators

### 5. Error Handling
- Add better error reporting from Flutter to JavaScript
- Implement proper error handling for asset loading
- Add user feedback for initialization issues

## Current Issues
1. Diagram not visible despite successful initialization
2. Need to verify JavaScript-to-Flutter communication
3. Need to add debug logging for troubleshooting

## Next Steps
1. Add debug logging to Flutter initialization
2. Verify diagram layer is being created correctly
3. Test JavaScript API functions individually
4. Consider adding visual debugging aids (borders, background colors)
5. Update integration guide with findings

## Notes for Integration Guide Update
- Include section about proper asset management
- Document CoordinateSystem parameter requirements
- Add troubleshooting section for common issues
- Include example of proper Flutter web initialization
- Document required MIME types and server configuration
