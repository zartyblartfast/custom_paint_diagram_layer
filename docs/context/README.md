# Context Documentation

This directory contains documentation focused on maintaining context and understanding of the project's core principles, current state, and implementation patterns.

## Quick Start
1. Start with [00_PROJECT_CORE.md](./00_PROJECT_CORE.md) for fundamental principles
2. Check [01_CURRENT_IMPLEMENTATION.md](./01_CURRENT_IMPLEMENTATION.md) for current state
3. Review [02_IMPLEMENTATION_PATTERNS.md](./02_IMPLEMENTATION_PATTERNS.md) for specific patterns

## Documentation Purpose
These documents exist to:
1. Maintain context between sessions
2. Ensure consistent implementation
3. Guide future development
4. Validate design decisions

## Key Principles
1. All diagram modifications through layer methods
2. Immutable state management
3. Clean separation of concerns
4. Proper coordinate system usage

## Using This Documentation
- Use as reference for implementation patterns
- Validate new features against core principles
- Update as implementation evolves
- Refer to examples for proper usage
