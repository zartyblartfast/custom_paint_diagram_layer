# Development Roadmap

## Current Status
The project has established a robust foundation with:
- Comprehensive coordinate system management
- Flexible element hierarchy
- Efficient rendering pipeline
- Strong type safety and immutability patterns

## Phase 1: Enhanced User Interaction (Short Term)

### 1. Element Selection and Manipulation
**Goal:** Provide intuitive element selection and manipulation capabilities.

**Tasks:**
1. Implement element hit testing
   - Accurate bounds calculation for all element types
   - Support for complex shapes (curves, groups)
   - Z-index based selection

2. Add element manipulation handles
   - Resize handles for applicable elements
   - Rotation pivot points
   - Scale preservation options

3. Enhance group operations
   - Multi-select capabilities
   - Group transformation controls
   - Nested group support

### 2. Advanced Styling System
**Goal:** Provide more sophisticated styling options.

**Tasks:**
1. Implement style inheritance
   - Group-based styling
   - Style overrides
   - Default styles system

2. Add gradient support
   - Linear gradients
   - Radial gradients
   - Pattern fills

3. Enhanced text rendering
   - Rich text support
   - Text wrapping
   - Text alignment options

## Phase 2: Performance Optimization (Medium Term)

### 1. Rendering Optimization
**Tasks:**
1. Implement element culling
   - View frustum culling
   - Detail level management
   - Efficient bounds checking

2. Canvas layer management
   - Layer-based rendering
   - Cached rendering for static elements
   - Selective redraw

3. Memory optimization
   - Element pooling for large diagrams
   - Efficient state management
   - Resource cleanup

### 2. Interaction Performance
**Tasks:**
1. Optimize hit testing
   - Spatial partitioning
   - Progressive hit testing
   - Cache hit test results

2. Smooth pan/zoom
   - Inertial scrolling

   - Level of detail transitions

## Phase 3: Extended Features (Long Term)

### 1. Animation System
**Tasks:**
1. Element animation framework
   - Property-based animations
   - Custom easing functions
   - Animation sequencing

2. Interactive animations
   - Gesture-driven animations
   - State transitions
   - Animation previews

### 2. Export and Integration
**Tasks:**
1. Export capabilities
   - Vector format export (SVG)
   - Raster format export
   - Animation export

2. Integration features
   - Framework-agnostic core
   - Web platform support
   - Native platform optimizations

## Future Considerations

### 1. Extensibility
- Plugin system for custom elements
- Custom rendering pipelines
- External tool integration
